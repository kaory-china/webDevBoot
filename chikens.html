        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
            <br>
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
            scrambled
            <br>
            it to make a type specimen book. It h as survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            <br>
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
            <br>
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker
            <br>
            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        </p>
        <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
        <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney
            College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
            and
            going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
            by
            Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            Renaissance.
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
